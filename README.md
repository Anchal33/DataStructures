# DataStructures

basic operations of different data Structures and various ways of Sorting Arrays.

Time complexities of :


1.Sorting Algorithms 

Bubble Sort     = O(n^2)
Selection Sort  = O(n^2)
Insertion Sort  = O(n^2)
Merge Sort      = O(n logn)
Quick Sort      = O(n logn)
Heap Sort       = O(n logn)

2.LinkedList

In worst case as well as Average Case Scenario

Traversal/Access = O(n)
Searching = O(n)
Insertion = O(1)
Deletion = O(1)

3.BinaryTree

Average Case Scenario

Traversal = O(n)
Searching = O(log n)
Insertion = O(log n)
Deletion = O(log n)

Worst Case Scenario

Traversal = O(n)
Searching = O(n)
Insertion = O(n)
Deletion = O(n)

4.Binary Search Tree

Average Case Scenario

Traversal = O(n)
Searching = O(log n)
Insertion = O(log n)
Deletion = O(log n)

Worst Case Scenario

Traversal = O(n)
Searching = O(n)
Insertion = O(n)
Deletion = O(n)
